At Library for Humanity, we believe that books should be accessible and readable by anyone, anywhere, regardless of culture, status, income, or any other demographics. We aspire to create a global library of free (gratis) resources, for the betterment of humanity.

We believe that content should be accessible without DRM technology; and that DRM enriches traditional publishers, gates content, and generally creates economic incentives to benefit the few over the many. You can read more about DRM [here](https://journals.ala.org/index.php/ltr/article/view/7253/9929).

Accordingly such, all our content is accessible DRM free, or with free (gratis) DRM (grants you the right to read the book).
